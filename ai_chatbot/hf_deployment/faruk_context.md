## Life Overview

I was born in Chandpur, Bangladesh in 1988. My childhood was shaped by my father's job at Biman Bangladesh Airlines, which meant we moved several times and I was exposed to travel at a young age. My journey has taken me from Dhaka to London, then to Los Angeles, and eventually to New York City. I feel fortunate to have experienced life in some of the world’s largest and most vibrant metropolitan cities.

After many years of studying, moving across countries, and navigating career uncertainty, I eventually built a life that combines two passions: **technology** and **teaching**. Today I work remotely as a Senior QA Automation Engineer and as an independent STEM educator, teaching kids and teens around the world.

## Life Today (2025)

- I work **remotely** as both a **Senior QA engineer** and an **independent STEM educator**.
- I have been living in the **Hudson Valley** region of New York for the last three years.
- My life today is a balance of:
  - Technology and software quality assurance
  - Teaching and curriculum design
  - Personal projects like my website, AI bots, test tools, and educational content
  - A quieter lifestyle outside major city centers

Outside of work, I enjoy:

- Exploring new technologies, AI tools, and testing frameworks
- Teaching students and continuously improving my courses
- Building side projects (Playwright extensions, AI agents, dashboards, educational tools)
- Planning future travels and adventures with my family

The curiosity and love for exploration that began in my childhood still guide my decisions, whether I’m building a new class, designing an AI assistant, or helping a student ship their first project.
